{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Background, problem statement and Approach:**\n","\n","This notebook is for mapping the business areas of focus with different levels of intervention categories attached to each area. We will use different different columns from FactInteventions table to map keywords with matching rules associated to each level of area of focus. The scoping document for this project is available on following confluence page\n","\n","https://ingeusbi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BD/pages/206471169/Scoping+-+Interventions+Categorization+DOD+Draft\n","\n","The keyword mapping rules in the mapping_rules dictionary, along with how the match_keywords function is designed to handle them, are crucial for ensuring accurate categorization based on textual content. Let's break down both the structure of the rules and the logic of the keyword matching function.\n","\n","**Understanding of Keyword Mapping Rules**\n","\n","The mapping_rules dictionary organizes information under various \"Areas of Focus,\" each containing several \"Levels\" that describe specific actions or considerations. Each level has:\n","\n","Description: A brief description of the action or focus at that level.\n","Keywords: A set of keywords designed to match related content in the textual data. These keywords are formatted in a way that indicates how they should be matched, using parentheses () and slashes /.\n","\n","**Examples:**\n","\n","Caring Responsibilities: Level 1\n","\n","Description: \"Bring children to appointments\"\n","Keywords: \"(Children) (childcare) (child)/ (appointment) (office)\"\n","This means the text should contain either \"children,\" \"childcare,\" or \"child\" AND \"appointment\" or \"office.\"\n","\n","Physical Capability: Level 3\n","\n","Description: \"Identify benefits of increasing Physical activity\"\n","Keywords: \"Physical/activity/benefits\"\n","This indicates a need for the presence of \"Physical,\" \"activity,\" and \"benefits\" in any order.\n","\n","**Keyword Matching Function Logic**\n","\n","The match_keywords function processes these keyword patterns to match text data effectively. Here’s how it works with the key aspects being addressed:\n","\n","Regular Expressions: It uses Python’s re module to create and apply regular expressions based on the keyword patterns.\n","\n","Plural and Singular Forms: By appending s? to the keywords (where applicable), the regex pattern accounts for both plural and singular forms. This regex adjustment is done in the prepare_regex function which modifies the keywords before they are compiled into regex patterns.\n","\n","Case Insensitivity: It performs case-insensitive matching (re.IGNORECASE) to ensure that variations in capitalization do not affect the matching process.\n","\n","Handling of Parentheses and Slashes:\n","\n","Parentheses (): Items within parentheses are treated as separate options within a group. The text should match any of the options listed within the parentheses.\n","Slashes /: These are used to denote essential words that must all appear in the text, though not necessarily adjacent to each other or in the order listed.\n","Stopwords Filtering: Common words like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"to,\" etc., are filtered out to prevent them from triggering matches that are not meaningful. This filtering occurs before the regex matching checks, thus ensuring that these common words do not skew the matching results.\n","\n","Applying the Matching Function\n","When match_keywords is invoked, it processes each group of keywords:\n","\n","It constructs a regex pattern for each keyword or group of keywords (considering stopwords and plural/singular forms).\n","It then checks the provided text against these patterns.\n","If a match is found based on the conditions set out by the keyword patterns (accounting for necessary groups and optionals), these keywords are added to the list of found keywords.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"ede0bd6e-0b23-4ee6-8353-78240c822db9"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###
